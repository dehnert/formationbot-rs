# FormationBot Discord bot

## Usage

Set up `config.yaml` with your bot's token.
The token can be found on the "Bot" tab of the [Discord developer portal][dev-portal].
The bot also requires the **Message Content Intent**, which must be enabled on
that page.

If you don't have it installed, [install Rust][install-rust].
Then, run `cargo run` to start the bot.
